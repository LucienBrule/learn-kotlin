### My Personal OSS Projects

I have open sourced a number of personal projects in Kotlin. Although the majority of my work in Kotlin has been in a professional context, where sharing the source outside of the organization would be a big no no. But alas, I tend to take the same patterns, and build newer and better ones! So skimming through my personal Open Source Projects might be enlightening. I may talk about some of them in more detail.
